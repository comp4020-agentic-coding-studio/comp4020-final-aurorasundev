# Gallery and AI keepsakes: implementation log

Factual checkpoint for resuming this feature. Plan:
[plans-gallery-ai.md](../../superpowers/plans/plans-gallery-ai.md); spec:
[design](../../superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-gallery-ai-keepsakes-design.md).

Started 2026-10-18 15:11 AEDT on branch `claude/gallery-ai-keepsakes` from
`08a7e9e`. The owner asked for periodic commits and pushes during the work;
they go to this feature branch, whose pushes run CI checks but do not deploy
(only `main` deploys).

## Task 0: baseline (done)

- Worktree clean apart from the untracked plan and spec.
- Fresh disposable DB, fixture moderation, `ARTIFACTS_ENABLED=0`, port 8121:
  `pnpm check` 16 files / **124 tests passed**; `pnpm check:evidence` passed.
- Screenshots of the current space, text write, drawing write and read at
  1366×768 and 390×844 in [baseline/](baseline/).

Next: Task 1 (migration 9 and the store).
